# mcc-2022

My own handwritten solutions for the Malaysian Computing Challenge 2022! Unfortunately due to time constraints and the fact that the event clashed with another event my school managed it did not allow me enough time to complete all of the challenges.

As such, the repository only contains problems that I did manage to figure out the solution to.
